# python-study-guide

This project that I made is a study guide website that's related to Python. In particular, Python and the definitions and concepts that are related to it that's important to know about. This website has a total of 33 different topics, and around three or four different questions and answers related to each of the topics that you can find on each of the pages for each topic.
