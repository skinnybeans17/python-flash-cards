# python-study-guide

This project that I made is a study guide website that's related to Python. In particular, Python and the definitions and concepts that are related to it that's important to know about. This website has a total of 33 different topics, and around three or four different questions and answers related to each of the topics that you can find on each of the pages for each topic.

## How this site is used

First, you will go on the website, and then you'll see 33 different topics on the main page. Each topic has it's own page, and you can go to each of those pages by clicking on the 'Learn More' button underneath each of the topic. There, you will see questions related to each of the topics, around three or four, sometimes five, for the topic as well as answers to each of the questions as well. This website is to be used as a study guide for people who don't know much about Python or want to learn more about it to have a better understanding of it and each of the concepts related to it as well.
