# python-flash-cards

This project that I made is a study guide website with flash cards that's related to Python. This website is a continuation of the last intensive project I made related to the vocabulary and key concepts, but this time, it's everything else in the flash cards set. This covers simple data types, lists and tuples, dictionaries, conditional statements, functions, classes, testing, and packages. There are a total of 68 flash cards here, through out all eight topics.

## How this site is used

First, you will go on the website, and then you'll see eight different topics on the main page. Each topic has it's own page, and you can go to each of those pages by clicking on the 'Learn More' button underneath each of the topic. There,you'll then see sub-topics related to the main subject you chose. When you click on the 'Learn More' underneath each of the sub-topics, you will see questions related to each of the sub-topics, around three or four, sometimes just two, and in rare cases only one, for the topic as well as answers to each of the questions as well. This website is to be used as a study guide for people who don't know much about Python or want to learn more about it to have a better understanding of it and each of the concepts related to it as well. All of the flash cards are represented with different colors, based on the subject you're learning about. Red, yellow, white, green, cyan, blue, gray, and black.

## Inspiration for website

I wanted to make this website because of me learning about coding for over a half-decade (five years) now. In particular, I wanted to base this site around Python and the concepts around it that I was learning about during my first semester here at college and a little bit before that in weekly classes I took before I came to Make School. During the winter break, I bought some flash cards related to Python, and reading those flash cards gave me an idea to base those cards around those subjects in the cards. I really liked this set of flash cards a lot, that I wanted to recreate in HTML and CSS. I did the first part of the set before, now I'm doing the rest of this educational set of cards!
